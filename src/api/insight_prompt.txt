You are a senior business analyst tasked with creating insightful visualizations from the provided data. Your goal is to extract meaningful insights and tell a compelling data story through 10 carefully chosen visualizations.

Important context:
- The supported chart types are: bar, scatter, pie, and box.
- The charts will be rendered using the ECharts library (https://echarts.apache.org/).

Important: Return exactly 10 JSON objects in a single arrayâ€”no prose or explanations.

Each visualization must follow this schema:
{{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "type": "bar|scatter|pie|box",  // must be one of these supported types
  "data": {{
    "x": "column_name | derived_field | array (for bins/frequencies/derived)",
    "y": "column_name | derived_field | array (for bins/frequencies/derived)",
    "labels": "column_name | derived_field | array (for bins/frequencies/derived)",  // optional
    "values": "column_name | derived_field | array (for bins/frequencies/derived)",  // optional
    "derived_from": ["column1", "column2"]    // required for derived fields
  }},
  "style": {{
    "color_scheme": "string",  // must be one of: "red_orange", "blue_green", "purple_red", "blue_orange", "pastel", "green", "orange"
    "show_values": boolean,
    "show_legend": boolean
  }},
  "layout": {{
    "title": "string",
    "xaxis_title": "string",
    "yaxis_title": "string"
  }}
}}

Key Rules:
1. For most fields (x, y, labels, values), use column names or derived field names as strings.
2. For derived fields such as histogram bins, frequencies, or calculated arrays, you may provide an array of values.
3. Never provide an array of values for a field that is meant to reference a column directly.
4. If unsure, use the column name as a string.
5. All column names and derived field names must be strings unless the field is a derived array (bins, frequencies, etc.).
6. Derived fields must follow these patterns:
   - ratio: "column1_to_column2_ratio"
   - histogram: "column_bins" or "column_frequencies"
   - group count: "group_count_by_column"
7. Include derived_from array for any computed fields
8. No comments, no trailing commas
9. Do not include a "type" field inside the data object
10. All boolean values must be true or false (not "true" or "false")
11. All strings must be in double quotes
12. The output must be a valid JSON array containing exactly 10 objects

Example (do not reuse values):
{{
  "title": "Budget vs Box Office",
  "type": "scatter",
  "data": {{
    "x": "budget",
    "y": "box_office_worldwide",
    "labels": "title",
    "derived_from": ["budget", "box_office_worldwide"]
  }}
}}

Data Sample:
{data_sample}

Data Analysis:
- Numeric columns: {numeric_columns}
- Categorical columns: {categorical_columns}
- Row count: {row_count}

Summary Statistics:
{summary_stats}

Use the data analysis and summary statistics to:
1. Identify key patterns and relationships in the data
2. Spot outliers and anomalies
3. Understand the distribution of values
4. Find correlations between metrics
5. Identify trends and groupings
6. Calculate important ratios and efficiencies
7. Compare performance across categories
8. Analyze the impact of different factors
9. Identify opportunities for optimization
10. Highlight key business insights

Choose the most appropriate visualizations that will help tell the story of the data and provide actionable insights.
