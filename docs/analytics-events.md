# Analytics Events Dictionary

Canonical catalogue of every product-analytics event ChartSage emits (PostHog).

**Why this matters.** These events are how we see what the product *and the models* are
doing — activation, credit economics, and (since 2026-06-06) **model-output quality** such
as the chart-fallback rate. Analytics is a first-class concern: a feature isn't done until
its events exist and this file describes them.

**Maintenance rule — do this in the SAME change.** Whenever you add, rename, re-prop, or
remove an event, update this file in the same PR/commit:
- New event or new prop → add it / note it with a dated line in **Lifecycle**.
- Removed event → keep the row, mark `Removed YYYY-MM-DD` (never silently delete — dashboards
  and downstream queries depend on knowing it went away).
- Renamed event → leave the old row as `Renamed → new_name (YYYY-MM-DD)` and add the new one.

**Conventions**
- **Backend**: `posthog.capture(distinct_id, "<event>", {props})` in `src/api/main.py`, via
  `PostHogServer` (`src/api/posthog_server.py`). Analytics never breaks product flow — capture
  failures are swallowed at WARN.
- **Frontend**: `posthog.capture?.('<event>', {props})` (client). `posthog.identify` ties the
  anon id → user id on login.
- Every event carries PostHog's `distinct_id` (anon or user identity). `reportId` identifies
  the report/session where relevant.
- **"baseline"** in Lifecycle = catalogued 2026-06-06; precise creation dates before that
  weren't tracked. Date everything from here on.

## Model output & generation — the quality signals

| Event | Src | Trigger | Key props | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `report_generation_started` | BE | `/generate-report` accepted (after credit check) | **reportId**, rowCount, columnCount, filename, sizeBytes, deep, customPrompt | baseline · **2026-06-07: +reportId** (join key) |
| `report_generation_succeeded` | BE | report built + persisted | reportId, rowCount, columnCount, chartCount, **usedFallback**, **fallbackChartCount**, modelSelection, modelNarrative, input/output/cacheReadTokens, estCostUsd, elapsedMs, deep, customPrompt | baseline · **2026-06-06: +usedFallback, +fallbackChartCount** |
| `report_charts_composed` | BE | after a report is generated | reportId, chartCount, fallbackChartCount, modelChartCount, usedFallback, allFallback, fallbackRatio, chartKinds[], keyMetricsCount, modelSelection, deep, customPrompt, rowCount, columnCount | **Added 2026-06-06.** Primary model-output-quality event (see "Fallback rate" below). |
| `chart_generated` | BE | one per chart, after a report is generated | reportId, **chartId**, **kind**, **isFallback**, deep, customPrompt | **Added 2026-06-07.** One event per chart so the chart-kind mix is a simple breakdown by `kind` — see "Chart-type mix" below. |
| `report_generation_failed` | BE | generation raised | **reportId**, reason, errorClass, httpStatus, elapsedMs | baseline · **2026-06-07: +reportId** |
| `claude_overloaded` | BE | model 529/busy during selection | stage | baseline |
| `generate_more_started` | BE | `/generate-more` begins | reportId, existingChartCount | baseline |
| `generate_more_succeeded` | BE | extra charts appended | reportId, newChartCount, **chartKinds[]**, inputTokens, outputTokens, estCostUsd, elapsedMs | baseline · **2026-06-06: +chartKinds** |
| `generate_more_failed` | BE | generate-more raised | reportId, reason, errorClass?, elapsedMs | baseline |
| `deepen_started` | BE | `/deepen` begins | reportId, existingChartCount | baseline |
| `deepen_succeeded` | BE | iterative-deepening finished | reportId, newChartCount, elapsedMs | baseline |
| `deepen_failed` | BE | deepen raised | reportId, reason, … | baseline |
| `add_chart_started` | BE | `/add-chart` begins | reportId, mode, chartType | baseline |
| `add_chart_succeeded` | BE | one chart added | reportId, mode, chartKind, elapsedMs | baseline |
| `add_chart_failed` | BE | add-chart raised / produced no chart | reportId, reason, errorClass?, httpStatus?, elapsedMs | baseline |

**Joining request → report → charts (one key).** Every event in a generation request carries the same
**`reportId`**: `report_generation_started` (the request) → `report_generation_succeeded` /
`report_charts_composed` (report level) → `chart_generated` (per chart), and `report_generation_failed`
on the error path. So you can funnel or `JOIN ... USING (reportId)` start → outcome → chart mix.
`chart_generated` also carries a unique **`chartId`** (the chart's own id) for chart-level identity —
e.g. tying a chart to a later `add_chart` / `report_feedback`. *(reportId threaded through the request
2026-06-07; previously `started`/`failed` had none, so the request couldn't be joined to its report.)*

**Fallback rate (the motivating use case).** A chart is a *fallback* when chart-selection
(Haiku) returned too few charts and the deterministic heuristic (`pick_fallback_charts`) filled
in — marked by the `fallback:` `intent` prefix; computed by `chart_composition()` in
`src/api/fallback.py`. Compute the rate over `report_charts_composed`:
- **% of reports using any fallback** = share with `usedFallback = true`.
- **% of total-miss reports** (model picked *nothing*, like the 2026-06-06 hurricanes report) =
  share with `allFallback = true`.
- **avg fallback share per report** = mean of `fallbackRatio`.
Segment by `modelSelection`, `rowCount`/`columnCount`, `deep`, `customPrompt` to find where the
model under-selects.

**Chart-type mix.** `chart_generated` fires once per chart with its `kind` (one of: bar, grouped_bar,
dual_axis, histogram, scatter, line, pie, box, heatmap, treemap) and `isFallback`. Plot the
distribution with a **Trends** insight on `chart_generated` **broken down by `kind`** — a pie for the
overall split, or a stacked area / line to watch it over time. Add an `isFallback = true` filter to
split model picks from the heuristic fallback. (Added 2026-06-07 after a run of line-heavy reports —
this makes the skew visible; the report-level `chartKinds[]` array undercounts repeats within a report.)
