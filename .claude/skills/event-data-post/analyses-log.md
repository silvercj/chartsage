# Analyses posted — running log

Our record of every event-data post produced with the `event-data-post` skill
(Step 9). **Skim this before pitching** so we don't repeat an angle, and **append a
row after each post**: date, hook, event/topic, dataset (+ source), report URL,
hashtag, status.

**Status:** `Posted` = live on X · `Scheduled`/`Drafted` = queued in Buffer (auto-posts / saved draft) · `Ready` = built, not yet queued · `Backlog` = angle found, not built · `Paused` = started, blocked.

## Banked angles (found via EDA, not yet posted)

Surfaced while building a post but not used — future candidates. Skim before pitching.

- **Draws have ~tripled** — ~9% of men's WC matches were draws in the early tournaments vs ~23% now (peak 33% in 1982). The game got cagier (pairs with the goals decline). _Fjelstul matches._
- ~~Bookings per game ~doubled~~ → **built 2026-06-07 (Ready, see table)** — cards/game 1970–2022 (tripled to a 2006 peak, then cooled).
- ~~The shootout era~~ → **built 2026-06-07 (Ready, see table)** — shootout win rate by nation.
- ~~Biggest hammerings~~ → **built 2026-06-07 (In progress, see table)** — blowout-rate decline + 48-team angle.
- **Penalties ≈ 8% of all WC goals; own goals ≈ 2%.** _Fjelstul goals._
